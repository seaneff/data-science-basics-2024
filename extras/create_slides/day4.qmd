## Step 1: Plan
::: {.incremental}
- **Why** are you doing this in the first place?
- **Who** is your audience?
- **What** are you trying to communicate?
- **Where** are you going to share the graphic?
::: 

## Why are you doing this in the first place?

::: {layout-ncol=2}

::: {.incremental}
- **What are your goals?**
  - understand your data?
  - explore a topic?
  - deliver a message?
  - support a decision?
  - teach a new topic?
::: 

::: {.incremental}
-  **Why does this matter? **
  - Degree of effort
  - Level of complexity
  - Types of text

::: 

::: 

## Who is your audience?

::: {layout-ncol=2}

::: {.incremental}
-  **Who are they? **
- What are their expectations?
- How much background knowledge do they have?
- How interested are they?
::: 

::: {.incremental}
-  **Why does this matter? **
  - Context (types of data shown)
  - Style (specific styles or colors)
  - Level of detail (footnotes, etc)
::: 

::: 

## What are you trying to communicate?

::: {layout-ncol=2}

::: {.incremental}
-  **What's the point? **
  - today's status
  - change over time
  - comparing groups
  - highlight extremes
::: 

::: {.incremental}
-  **Why does this matter? **
  - Plot type 
  - Emphasis (color, text)
  
::: 

::: 

## Where are you doing to share the graphic?

::: {layout-ncol=2}

::: {.incremental}

## Your turn

Grab a piece of blank paper.

## Your turn

Imagine you have two weeks, access to any data you want, and the help of a big team of graphic designers, statistical programmers, and researchers. What would you work on with them? You have 5 minutes.

- **Why** are you doing this in the first place?
- **Who** is your audience?
- **What** are you trying to communicate?
- **Where** are you going to share the graphic?

## My turn

For today, we're going go work with a dataset on global refugee populations, based on data from the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR).

- **Why:** to learn more about the status of global refugee populations
- **Who:** ourselves
- **What:** general information about refugee populations
- **Where:** in class and maybe on our github repos

## Explore a new dataset

## Choosing a plot type

## Barcharts

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(refugees)
test <- read.csv("data/populations_unhcr.csv")
```

```{r}
head(test)
```

## Choosing a plot type

Over time, you'll develop a sense of **informed intuition** for selecting plot types. 

At first, play around and see what works well! 

And consult flowcharts and examples, if it's helpful.

## Refining a data visualization

## Three principles
- **Purpose**: Have a well-defined purpose
- **Clarity**: Show the data clearly
- **Message**: Make the message obvious

[Concept from Graphics Principles](https://graphicsprinciples.github.io/initiative.html)

## Simplify

- Simplify where possible
- Use less ink and more white space
- Avoid unnecessary clutter (like unnecessary gridlines)

## Meaningful tiles and labels

- Chose a meaningful title

## Minimize eye movement
  - place labels next to data
  - draw attention to the main points
  
## Make comparisons easy
  
- Make comparisons easy
  - use visual grouping (common shapes, colors, regions)
  - order values in a meaningful way
  - judgements are easier to make on a horizontal (vs. vertical) scale -- need citation
  - consider reference lines
  
## Understand existing conventions

These may vary from field to field
- Cause on x-axis, effect on y-axis

# Dashboards

## What is a dashboard?

A dashboard is a **visual display** of **the most important information** needed to achieve one or more objectives which fits entirely on a single computer screen, so it can be **monitored at a glance**.

[Definition from: Information Dashboard Design, Stephen Few](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1206491)<br>
::: 

## A brief history
- **1980s** early **'executive information systems'** developed by vendors
- **1990s** focus on **key performance indicators** (KPIs) in business
- **2000s** over **half of surveyed companies** use dashboards

## Types of dashboards

![](images/types_of_dashboards_few.jpg)

[Information Dashboard Design, Stephen Few](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1206491)<br>

## Purpose of dashboards

- **strategic**: provide a quick overview that decision-makers need to monitor the performance of an organization and to inform long-term strategic direction
  - simple display mechanisms 
  - data often daily, weekly, or monthly (vs. real-time)

-**dashboards for analytical purposes**

-**dashboards for operational purposes**
