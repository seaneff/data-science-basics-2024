## Goals for today

- How to create data visualizations
- Plan
- Design
- Build

# Creating a data visualization

## Steps:
- Plan
- Design
- Build
- Refine

# Planning

- Who
- What
- When
- Where
- Why

[Concept from Graphics Principles](https://graphicsprinciples.github.io/initiative.html)

## Why: What are your goals?

- Identify the purpose of the graph
  - deliver a message?
  - explore a topic?
  - support a decision?

## What: What are the data and evidence?

- Understand your data
  - type of data
  - volume of data
- Understand the evidence
  - what do the data say?

## Who: Who is the audience

specialists? non-specialists?

## Where:
 
Adapt the design to space or formatting constraints
- clinical report?
- poster?
- slide deck?
- publication?
- dashboard?

## When: How much time do you want to invest?


# Designing

## Choosing a plot type


## Visual elements

## Bouba/kiki effect

Which is kiki, and which is bouba?

## Bouba/kiki effect

::: {.incremental}
  - First observed in 1924 by a Georgian psychologist
  - How do people understand and interpret shapes, sounds, and words?
    - Participants given a list with nonsense words to match with shapes
    - Users consistently grouped certains words and shapes together

## Position
- Do not plot log-normally distributed variables on a linear scale 

## Shape
- Use position for comparisons rather than length (e.g., dots instead of bars), especially for non-linear scales

## Color

- Use color intentionally
  - existing or branded color palettes


# Building

# Refining

## Refining a data visualization

## Three principles
- **Purpose**: Have a well-defined purpose
- **Clarity**: Show the data clearly
- **Message**: Make the message obvious

[Concept from Graphics Principles](https://graphicsprinciples.github.io/initiative.html)

## Simplify

- Simplify where possible
- Use less ink and more white space
- Avoid unnecessary clutter (like unnecessary gridlines)

## Meaningful tiles and labels

- Chose a meaningful title

## Minimize eye movement
  - place labels next to data
  - draw attention to the main points
  
## Make comparisons easy
  
- Make comparisons easy
  - use visual grouping (common shapes, colors, regions)
  - order values in a meaningful way
  - judgements are easier to make on a horizontal (vs. vertical) scale -- need citation
  - consider reference lines
  
## Understand existing conventions

These may vary from field to field
- Cause on x-axis, effect on y-axis

# Dashboards

## What is a dashboard?

A dashboard is a **visual display** of **the most important information** needed to achieve one or more objectives which fits entirely on a single computer screen, so it can be **monitored at a glance**.

[Definition from: Information Dashboard Design, Stephen Few](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1206491)<br>
::: 

## A brief history
- **1980s** early **'executive information systems'** developed by vendors
- **1990s** focus on **key performance indicators** (KPIs) in business
- **2000s** over **half of surveyed companies** use dashboards

## Types of dashboards

![](images/types_of_dashboards_few.jpg)

[Information Dashboard Design, Stephen Few](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1206491)<br>

## Purpose of dashboards

- **strategic**: provide a quick overview that decision-makers need to monitor the performance of an organization and to inform long-term strategic direction
  - simple display mechanisms 
  - data often daily, weekly, or monthly (vs. real-time)

-**dashboards for analytical purposes**

-**dashboards for operational purposes**
