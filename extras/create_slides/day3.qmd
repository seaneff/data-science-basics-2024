- One thing you're excited about
- One thing you'd like to learn

# What is exploratory data analysis?

## Exploratory data analysis

::: {.incremental}
- Generate questions about our data
- Summarize and visualize data to answer those questions
- Use what we learn to generate new questions
- No formal pattern, just an iterative cycle
::: 

## Why do we do exploratory analysis?

::: {.incremental}
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) helps us understand our data:
  - understand patterns
  - identify errors or "weirdness"
  - detect outliers and anomalies
  - better understand relationships between variables
  - avoid mistaken assumptions
